# JS

This is the newest version (_WIP!_) of the javascript files used for [Pentagame/boardgame](https://github.com/Penta-Game/boardgame).

This requires [`svg.js`](https://svgjs.com/) and comes with a tested version. [Svg.js](https://svgjs.com/docs/3.0/) is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/svgdotjs/svg.js/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

## Known Problems

This implementation has problems with overlapping elements. This may occur at edges of outer rings by stops, corner and junction elements. This will be fixed (at some point) but if you have a working fix feel free to open a pull request.u
